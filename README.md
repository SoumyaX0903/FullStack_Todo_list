now in the above url we can write for eg localhost:3000/work or /anything we want and a custom todolist for that particular topic gets created 
and like this we can have 100s of diff custom todolist and all our data is maintained by MongoDB
 
 For eg i am showing a custom music todo list by typing (localhost:3000/Music)

and now we can add activities in our custom music todo list
